I finally made the move to [Typo](http://typo.leetsoft.com)

Since I am planning on doing some typo hacking, I first set up a [svk](http://svk.elixus.org/) environment, as described by [Scott Laird](http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/tag/svk).

At the moment, this blog is still mostly &#8220;out-of-the-box&#8221;, but at least now there&#8217;s some &#8220;tangible&#8221; code to hack on.

BTW: I just noticed, that [MarsEdit](http://www.ranchero.com/marsedit/) can preview [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). That&#8217;s some sweet program.</p>
