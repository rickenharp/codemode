Blogging has become way too mainstream.

In three different episodes of three different shows, one of the characters made a reference to blogging. The first one was &#8220;How I met your mother&#8221;, where Barney says &#8220;This is totally going in my blog&#8221;.

I don&#8217;t remember what the other two shows were, probably &#8220;The War at Home&#8221; and &#8220;The Showbiz Show&#8221;, but I think blogging is about to jump the shark&#8230;

Lucky for me this isn&#8217;t a blog. It gets updated not nearly enough to qualify ;)
